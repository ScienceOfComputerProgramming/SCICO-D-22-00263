# Aircraft

## Model

* Proposed in: 
  * Platzer, AndrÃ© & Clarke, Edmund. (2009). Formal Verification of Curved Flight Collision Avoidance Maneuvers: A Case Study. 547-562. 10.1007/978-3-642-05089-3_35. 
* Used by:
  * R. Lal and P. Prabhakar, "Bounded error flowpipe computation of parameterized linear systems," *2015 International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT)*, 2015, pp. 237-246, doi: 10.1109/EMSOFT.2015.7318279.

Following state variables:

* $x_1$: Position of the vehicle in, say, $x$ axis.
* $x_2$: Position of the vehicle in, say, $y$ axis. 
* ($d_1$,$d_2$): Velocity in the respective directions.

Parameters:

* $\omega$: Angular velocity, which is a parameter that changes depending on the mode of the airplane. In particular, some complicated computation is used to set its value during a mode change. Hence, the value is not known a priori, however, a bound on its value can be inferred.

## Behavior of the system

* Initial Set:

  * ```python
    P = [ (1.1,1.11), (1.1,1.11), (20,20.1), (20,20.1) ]
    ```

* $\omega$ = 1

* `Time Step: 400`. NOTE: Our monitoring experiments will, although, be for 2000 steps.

* NOTE: This behavior doesn't assume any perturbation on the parameter $\omega$. But our monitoring experiments will.

## Case Study

In this case study we will stress-test our monitoring algorithms. In particular, we answer the following questions:

* Case 1: Demonstrate offline monitoring case where the logs are borderline-safe to unsafe.
* Case 2: Demonstrate offline monitoring case where time-gap between two logs are significant. In other words, the logging probability is significantly small.
* Case 3: Demonstrate online monitoring where the system is robustly-safe. 

### Case 1

* Perturbation: $\omega \pm 1\%$, where $\omega=1$.

* Initial Set (Same as above):

  * ```python
    P = [ (1.1,1.11), (1.1,1.11), (20,20.1), (20,20.1) ]
    ```

* Probability of Logging: 7%

### Case 2

* Perturbation: $\omega \pm 1\%$, where $\omega=1$.

### Case 3

* Perturbation: $\omega \pm 0.01\%$, where $\omega=1$.

    ```

NOTE: Here, the perturbation has been reduced to a very low number. This was done to stress-test our online monitoring.
